========================================================================= Introduction =========================================================================

Hello! My name is Allen and this is the first entry in a series of changelogs on building floState.

So what is floState? 

It's a timer app that optimizes your showers so that you save time and water while keeping clean. 

It uses linear algebra algorithms to optimize your shower times and segments down to a personally set sustainable-living goals!

The goal of this app is to reduce water waste.

I am following a guide by Net Ninja on YouTube 'Complete React Native Tutorial', and making the changes where I see fit. 

I am using my phone as simulation using the Expo Go app.

Thanks for checking this out!
