Introduction 
=========================================================================

Hello! My name is Allen and this is the first entry in a series of changelogs on building floState.

So what is floState? 

It's a timer app that optimizes your showers so that you save time and water while keeping clean. 

It uses linear algebra algorithms to optimize your shower times and segments down to a personally set sustainable-living goals!

The goal of this app is to reduce water waste.

I am following a guide by Net Ninja on YouTube 'Complete React Native Tutorial', and making the changes where I see fit. 

I am using my phone as simulation using the Expo Go app.

Thanks for checking this out!

Since this is first change log, the first version is uploading the root project folder and the default folders created by NPM.

In this first commit, there is nothing but a blank screen.

This commit is just the initializing of some files in the project.


Comments: 

I have been going through some other name ideas for this app but nothing seems to stick.
